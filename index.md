## Welcome to my GitHub Repository

I am a professor at [Saint Mary's University](https://smu.ca) in beautiful Halifax.  Although most of my research is in the field of population economics, my current focus is on genomics, unconventional data, chronic disease surveillance systems, and machine learning.  I teach data analytics courses at undergraduate and graduate levels. This Github page will contain all my work including chapters from my never ending book, Machine Learning, my blogs about anything "useful", and my teaching.

We are a group of researchers from Dalhousie and Saint Mary's Universities in Halifax, and collaborators all over the world.  We want to make machine learning methods more accessible in social and health science applications for better predictive and causal analyses.   We hope to provide a platform for statistical learning by enhancing collaboration between academic circles, policy makers, and private enterprises by disseminating the knowledge that helps others in their works, projects, course offerings, and private applications.
