## Welcome to my GitHub Repository

I am a professor at [Saint Mary's University](https://smu.ca) in beautiful Halifax.  Although most of my research is in the field of population economics, my current focus is on genomics, unconventional data, chronic disease surveillance systems, and machine learning.  I teach data analytics courses at undergraduate and graduate levels. This Github page will contain all my work including chapters from my never ending book, Machine Learning, my blogs about anything "useful", and my teaching.

## <a name="head1235"></a>My Book (coming soon)
([Unedited content as of December 2019](https://raw.githack.com/yaydede/MLBook/main/index.html))
  
This book is collection of my lecture and lab notes.  It will be online and free.  I will accept donations for pdf and downloadanle versions.  It is designed for business students in general and economics/statistics students in particular.  It's also useful for computer science students as they learn statistical backgrounds in self-learning algorithms.  I've used the chapters from the book in the 3-day [Summer School](https://sites.google.com/view/mlportal/online-events?authuser=0) where most participants were academic economists.  So it is also beneficial to "translate" machine learning and link it to econometrics for social scientists and applied economists. 
  
The latest version of my book has been copyedited and contains additional topics such as, balancing with classification problems, penalized regresssions, time-series forecasting with machine learning, recursive neural network applications, LSTM, feature engineering, random forest with time-series data.  I am expecting the book will be availbale before December 2020.  If you need sections from my book, please let me know.

We are a group of researchers from Dalhousie and Saint Mary's Universities in Halifax, and collaborators all over the world.  We want to make machine learning methods more accessible in social and health science applications for better predictive and causal analyses.   We hope to provide a platform for statistical learning by enhancing collaboration between academic circles, policy makers, and private enterprises by disseminating the knowledge that helps others in their works, projects, course offerings, and private applications.
