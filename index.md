![me](https://raw.githack.com/yaydede/Yigit_Aydede/main/Me.png)
  
I am a professor in the Department of Economics at [Saint Mary's University](https://smu.ca) in beautiful Halifax.  Although most of my research is in the field of population economics, my current focus is on genomics, unconventional data, chronic disease surveillance systems, and machine learning.  I teach data analytics courses at undergraduate and graduate levels. This Github page summarizes all my work including a draft version my book, [Tool Shed](https://yaydede.github.io/ToolShed/), my blogs about anything "useful", and my teaching.

- Starting July 1 in 2021, I am appointed to [Sobey Professorship in Economics](https://www.smu.ca/academics/sobey/sobey-professorships-and-chairs.html) for 5 years.
- I just finished my one year term as a visiting professor at Free University of Bozen - Bolzano ([UniBZ](https://www.unibz.it)).   
- I am a founder member of [Research Portal on Machine Learning for Social and Health Policies](https://sites.google.com/view/mlportal/home), where, in collaboration with one of my colleagues, we orginize scintific events.  I have organized a 3-day online [Summer School](https://sites.google.com/view/mlportal/online-events?authuser=0), **Machine Learning for Economists and Applied Social Scientists**, followed by a 2-day [Webinar](https://sites.google.com/view/mlportal/online-events/webinar-series?authuser=0) series. More than 60 faculty and researchers attended these fee-based online lectures and more than 260 participants registered for the 2-day long webinar in 2020.
- We just finished (24-25 August 2022) our [1st Workshop of Applied Microeconomics](https://sites.google.com/view/mlportal/online-events/1st-workshop-of-applied-microeconomics?authuser=0).  See you next year!  
- As many other researchers, I've also worked on COVID-19.  I've just finished a project (as a PI) selected to the [Nova Scotia COVID19 Research Coalition](https://researchns.ca/2020/05/26/using-machine-learning-to-predict-viral-transmission-rates-in-halifax/). I've also served at [Reimagining the Future for Nova Scotians](https://www.dal.ca/faculty/management/news-events/reimagine-ns.html) where academic and community experts are put together to see what opportunities are possible for Nova Scotia.
- I have been teaching a course, [Introduction to Applied Machine Learning with R](https://raw.githack.com/yaydede/Teaching/main/MLPoster.pdf) since Winter 2020.  It is the first and only machine learning course in the [Sobey School of Business](https://www.smu.ca/academics/sobey/) that also has programming Labs. Moreover, I will also be teaching "MBAN 5610 Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning" at the new Master of Business Analytics ([MBAN](https://www.smu.ca/mban/index.html)) program in March 2023.
- I present and dissaminate my work using unconventional data and the latest methods in Machine Learning here in my blog post series. (See CBC NEWS - [How well have Canadians complied with COVID-19 restrictions? New data offers a glimpse](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/mobility-covid-restrictions-compliance-1.5956947))

## My Recent Articles & CV

My recent CV can be found [here](https://raw.githack.com/yaydede/Credentials/main/CV5.pdf) 
  
One of my latest papers, [Assortative preferences in choice of major](https://content.sciendo.com/view/journals/izajole/9/1/article-20200006.xml) is the first paper that documents the field-of-study homogamy in Canada and quantifies the assortative preferences between parents and children in choice of majors. The paper attributes this persisting assortative tendency to the information asymmetry across alternative majors built on by parents’ educational backgrounds within families.  Here is an interesting table that shows the assortative preferences in their children’s choice of major:  
  
![](https://raw.githack.com/yaydede/Articles/main/FSA.png)

The paper uses a more disaggregated classification of majors than the table.  However, even this table shows the attraction of children to their parents’ majors evaluated by the observed distribution of all possible matches between parents and children normalized between 0 and 1.

## My Book - Tool Shed

This book will be a collection of my lecture notes.  It is designed for business students in general and economics/statistics students in particular.  It's also useful for computer science students as they learn statistical backgrounds of self-learning algorithms.  I've used the chapters of this book in the 3-day [Summer School](https://sites.google.com/view/mlportal/online-events?authuser=0) where most participants were academic economists.  So it is also beneficial for those who want to "link" machine learning to econometrics as a social scientist or an applied economist. 
  
The book is coming soon and being copyedited currently.  It contains additional topics such as, **Dimension Reduction Methods, Classification with Rebalancing, Model Selection with Penalized Regresssions, Nonparametrics Time-series Forecasting, Graphical Network Anaylsis, Guide for Algorithmic Optimization with R**.  The book is growing in its content every other month.  

I am realy hoping that the book will be available before December 2022.  A draft version of Tool Shed is available in my Github repo.  Any comment is well appreciated ... 

The first draft can be found here: [Tool Shed](https://yaydede.github.io/ToolShed/)

## Research Portal on Machine Learning for Social and Health Policies
***
In 2018, in collaboration with two colleagues, I co-founded an educational research center to promote research and public education on social and health policies with machine learning applications, [Research Portal on Machine Learning for Social and Health Policy](http://www.ml-portal.com/). Under the umbrella of this research portal, we currently have ten researchers actively working on subjects that range from the prediction of chronic diseases using better surveillance systems to issues related to the design of a better selection process for immigration policies by providing policy makers with a recommender system.

## Teaching
***
I teach my quantitative courses by using mostly R.  In each course, simulation exercises are required. I provide my simulations in four languages: **R, C++, Python**, and **Stata**.  All these scripts will be available soon in these repositories here.  In Econometrics, the focus is on "causality" based on replications of major papers/methods, while I teach forecasing and prediction in other courses.      

- MBAN 5506 Machine Learning & AI
- MFIN 6603 Applied Statistics and Data Analysis. 
- MFIN 6609 Econometrics and Business Forecasting.
