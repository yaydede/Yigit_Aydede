I am a professor at [Saint Mary's University](https://smu.ca) in beautiful Halifax.  Although most of my research is in the field of population economics, my current focus is on genomics, unconventional data, chronic disease surveillance systems, and machine learning.  I teach data analytics courses at undergraduate and graduate levels. This Github page will contain all my work including chapters from my never ending book, Machine Learning, my blogs about anything "useful", and my teaching.

## <a name="head1224"></a>My Recent Articles
My most recent articles are published in [IZA](https://www.iza.org) journals and online.  They can be found here at my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=8M2YA1QAAAAJ&hl=en) site.  

My latest paper, [Assortative preferences in choice of major](https://content.sciendo.com/view/journals/izajole/9/1/article-20200006.xml) is accepted by [IZA Journal of Labor Economics](https://content.sciendo.com/view/journals/izajole/izajole-overview.xml).  It's the first paper that documents the field-of-study homogamy in Canada and quantifies the assortative preferences between parents and children in choice of majors. The paper attributes this persisting assortative tendency to the information asymmetry across alternative majors built on by parents’ educational backgrounds within families.  Here is an interesting table that shows the assortative preferences in their children’s choice of major:

The paper uses a more disaggregated classification in majors than this table uses.  However, even this table shows the attraction of children to their parents’ majors evaluated by the observed distribution of all possible matches between parents and children normalized between 0 and 1.  

## <a name="head1235"></a>My Book (coming soon)
([Unedited content as of December 2019](https://raw.githack.com/yaydede/MLBook/main/index.html))
  
This book is a collection of my lecture and lab notes.  It will be online and free.  I will accept donations for pdf and downloadable versions.  It is designed for business students in general and economics/statistics students in particular.  It's also useful for computer science students as they learn statistical backgrounds of self-learning algorithms.  I've used the chapters of this book in the 3-day [Summer School](https://sites.google.com/view/mlportal/online-events?authuser=0) where most participants were academic economists.  So it is also beneficial for those who want to "link" machine learning to econometrics as a social scientist or an applied economist. 
  
The latest version of my book is being copyedited currently and contains additional topics such as, **rebalancing data in classification problems, penalized regresssions, time-series forecasting with machine learning, recursive neural network applications, LSTM, feature engineering, random forest with time-series data**.  As you can expect, the book is growing in its content every other month.  

I am realy hoping that the book will be available before December 2020.  If you need sections from my book, please let me know.

I made one section, I belive the most important section, a blog post.  You may check it if you want to see the difference of the book from other "100-page ML" books.

I am one of the three founders of this educational hub. Since 2018, we had many research projects, mostly in collaboration with local institutions.  Recently, we had a 3-day summer school completely non-commercial.  We had more than 50 scientists enrolled in the course.  Following the course we held a 2-day webinar, **Machine Learning for Economists and Applied Social Scientists** with 10 well-known speakers and more than 170 participants.  All webinar video series are available on our website.  The summer school material will also be available at the website and here, in my Github repository very soon.
