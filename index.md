## Welcome to my GitHub Repository

I am a professor at [Saint Mary's University](https://smu.ca) in beautiful Halifax.  Although most of my research is in the field of population economics, my current focus is on genomics, unconventional data, chronic disease surveillance systems, and machine learning.  I teach data analytics courses at undergraduate and graduate levels. This Github page will contain all my work including chapters from my never ending book, Machine Learning, my blogs about anything "useful", and my teaching.

## <a name="head1224"></a>My Recent Articles
My most recent articles are published in [IZA](https://www.iza.org) journals and online.  They can be found here at my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=8M2YA1QAAAAJ&hl=en)site.  

My latest paper, [Assortative preferences in choice of major](https://content.sciendo.com/view/journals/izajole/9/1/article-20200006.xml) is accepted by [IZA Journal of Labor Economics](https://content.sciendo.com/view/journals/izajole/izajole-overview.xml).  It's the first paper that documents the field-of-study homogamy in Canada and quantifies the assortative preferences between parents and children in choice of majors. The paper attributes this persisting assortative tendency to the information asymmetry across alternative majors built on by parents’ educational backgrounds within families.  Here is an interesting table that shows the assortative preferences in their children’s choice of major:

## <a name="head1235"></a>My Book (coming soon)
([Unedited content as of December 2019](https://raw.githack.com/yaydede/MLBook/main/index.html))
  
This book is a collection of my lecture and lab notes.  It will be online and free.  I will accept donations for pdf and downloadable versions.  It is designed for business students in general and economics/statistics students in particular.  It's also useful for computer science students as they learn statistical backgrounds of self-learning algorithms.  I've used the chapters of this book in the 3-day [Summer School](https://sites.google.com/view/mlportal/online-events?authuser=0) where most participants were academic economists.  So it is also beneficial for those who want to "link" machine learning to econometrics as a social scientist or an applied economist. 
  
The latest version of my book is being copyedited currently and contains additional topics such as, **rebalancing data in classification problems, penalized regresssions, time-series forecasting with machine learning, recursive neural network applications, LSTM, feature engineering, random forest with time-series data**.  As you can expect, the book is growing in its content every other month.  

I am realy hoping that the book will be available before December 2020.  If you need sections from my book, please let me know.

I made one section, I belive the most important section, a blog post.  You may check it if you want to see the difference of the book from other "100-page ML" books.

We are a group of researchers from Dalhousie and Saint Mary's Universities in Halifax, and collaborators all over the world.  We want to make machine learning methods more accessible in social and health science applications for better predictive and causal analyses.   We hope to provide a platform for statistical learning by enhancing collaboration between academic circles, policy makers, and private enterprises by disseminating the knowledge that helps others in their works, projects, course offerings, and private applications.
